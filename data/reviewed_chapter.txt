## The Gates of Morning, Book 1, Chapter 1: The Canoe Builder

Dick stood on a coral ledge, his gaze fixed on the southern horizon. Behind him, the outer ocean roared, its spray scattered by the wind. Before him, the calm lagoon of Karolin stretched, an immense expanse of blue alive with circling gulls.

Enclosed by a forty-mile coral reef, this vast lagoon was a sea in itself; tempestuous in strong winds, tranquil and azure in gentler breezes.  And it was his – his since his arrival only yesterday.

Along the beach, bathed in the blazing sun, the tribe bustled: women, children, and youths fishing, playing, or mending their *paraka* nets. They were his people. The canoes drawn up on the sand, the empty houses that once housed war canoes – all were now his.

His gaze shifted from the lagoon to the canoe houses, his brow furrowing. Turning his back on the tranquil lagoon, he faced the crashing breakers of the northern sea. Beyond the unseen horizon lay Palm Tree Island, a place of breathtaking beauty.
